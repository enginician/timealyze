# timealyze
Tool for rhythm and timing training. The app records and analyzes simple rhythms for (relative) timing.

You need a metronome (ideally with headphones) for this app to work properly

## Simplified instructions:

1. Download and launch .exe-file
2. Listen to external metronome's click (with headphones or way quieter than what you are playing)
3. Click "start"
4. Play/clap/snap rhythm in sync to click
5. Click "stop"
6. Adjust tempo in App according to external metronome's click
7. Optionally adjust analysis parameters
8. Click "timealyze"

## Maturity:

Highly immature, it barely runs :) This project's main focus is for me to learn
